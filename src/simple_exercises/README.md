# Rust Learning Repository: Simple Exercises

## Structure
#### Each exercise will have its own .rs file with the challenge in the name. <br> You can run each exercise directly from main.rs in the root:
 
 - Receive two numbers from the user and count down or up depending on the first number entered:
   <i>counting_1_to_10_rust.rs</i><br><br>
 - Receive a vector of integers and returns the largest number found.
   This function must be able to traverse the vector and find the largest value within it.<br>
   <i>largest_number_found.rs</i><br><br>
 - Receive a number and check if this input number is prime number or not
   This function must be able to receive number and return if is prime or not.<br>
   <i>prime_number.rs</i>
 - Receive an integer and displays its multiplication table.
   This function must be able to receive an integer and display its multiplication table.<br>
   <i>multiplication_table.rs</i>
 - Implement an algorithm that receives a string and returns if the string has only unique characters.
   This function must be able to receive a string and return if the string has only unique characters.<br>
   <i>unique_characters.rs</i>
